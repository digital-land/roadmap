We support [policymakers](https://digital-land.github.io/users/policy-maker/) using [digital design](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual)
and tools to develop better standards for data and APIs for planning and housing data.

We do this by running [projects](https://digital-land.github.io/project/) to discover and understand users, and collect their need for planning and housing data.

We also work with people in [local government](https://digital-land.github.io/users/local-government/) to ensure the data is something which they can
easily keep and maintain, and which they benefit from publishing.

The outputs of a project may include one or more new data [specifications](https://digital-land.github.io/specification/),
some [guidance](https://digital-land.github.io/guidance/) for publication,
and possibly legislation or other regulation to ensure it is available, and sustained nationally.
. to publish and maintain, leading to data which meets the needs of [PropTech](https://digital-land.github.io/users/proptech/) users.
Help policymakers develop better data specifications and registers.

These in turn should lead to higher quality data that is:

* better able to support the aims of [policymakers](https://digital-land.github.io/users/policy-maker/)
* easier for our [local government](https://digital-land.github.io/users/local-government/) users to publish and maintain
* meets the needs of [PropTech](https://digital-land.github.io/users/proptech/) users when building services
